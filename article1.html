    <p>At least 310 bodies have been recovered so far from the mass grave at the medical complex after the Israeli army withdrew from the city on April 7, according to Gaza’s civil defense agency.</p>
    <p>The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has condemned the “continued tragic massacre” of Palestinians by Israel following the discovery of a mass grave within the Nasser Medical Complex in the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.</p>
    <p>In a statement on Monday, the OIC said the discovery is an indication that “hundreds of displaced, injured and the sick as well as medical convoys were subjected to forms of torture and abuse before they were executed and given mass burial.”</p>
    <p>At least 310 bodies have been recovered so far from the mass grave at the medical complex after the Israeli army withdrew from the city on April 7, according to Al-Jazeera. The army’s withdrawal followed a four-month ground offensive.</p>
